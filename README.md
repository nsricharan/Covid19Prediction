# Covid19Prediction
**Title**: Covid19-PREDICTION-AND-IDENTIFICATION-WITH-MACHINE-LEARNING

**Tool Used**: Google Colab-Colab

**Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression Algorithm

**Objective**:
The objective of Covid19 disease identification with machine learning is to detect the Covid19 disease in the early stage itself with the available attributes. 
It will be helpful for the human to detect disease at early stage and to take necessary treatments in the correct time to save life.

**Execution Process**:
Open google colabs in the browser and it will create a colab Notebooks in our Google drive. 

Inside the colab Notebooks, we will create a folder for covid19 and all upload the required dataset files.

Then open a console in google colabs and upload python code Covid19_prediction file and start executing step by step to see the results of data analysis, visualization and predictions.

Dataset filename:
CovidCaseDetails_ensemble.csv
